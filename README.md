# problem statement
1 . Given an array of integers and a target value, you must determine which two integers' sum
equals the target and return a 2D array. Then merge the array into a single array with sorting (
ascending ) order, in the next step double the target value and find again the combination of
digits (can be multiple digits ) that are equal to the double targeted value and returned into a 2D
array.
